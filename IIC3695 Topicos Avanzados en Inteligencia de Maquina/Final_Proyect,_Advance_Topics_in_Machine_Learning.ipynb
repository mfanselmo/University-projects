        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "For university professors and administrators, knowing how many students will take a course in advance allows them to plan and organize the subject in a better way, so that they can prepare the course better and create a better class environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the number of students that the engineering school of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile has, which exceeds 3000, knowing how many students are going to take a course allows you to better manage resources by opening or closing courses vacancies if necessary. A great cost (monetary and time) for the engineering school comes from how many teachers and students to assign for a each course and sections, and it is bad for both students and those in charge to have crowded or empty classrooms. For this reason, a system that tells how many vacancies are going to be needed per course based on different variables could be very useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the above, we propose a Bayesian Neural Network Model that predicts which courses is going to take each student based on what have they taken in previous semesters. We are going to use data obtained from the computer science department of course applications since 2015. It includes what each student has taken, in which semester and in which major and minor they are.\n",
        "\n",
        "All of this is was achived by using concepts learned from the course that can be applied to the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical framework\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our proposal is based on a Bayesian implementation of neural networks. These are models capable of classifying information based on different parameters, all through supervised learning, since we are passing many inputs with their respective classes, so that they \"learn\" how to classify.\n",
        "There are many types of neural networks, each with different uses:\n",
        "![tipos de redes](https://img.microsiervos.com/images2016/Neural-Networks-Chart.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "But we are going to look at the simplest, the multilayer perceptron, because it is the most used, and supported by libraries that do this type of work. It has an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer, with an activation function. In each connection there is a weight and an associated \"bias\", which are necessary for all calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why networks Bayesian neural networks?\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, classical neural networks have given excellent results in various fields, being used in a multitude of contexts, such as image classification, text creation, etc. The problem they have is that they need an enormous amount of data to be trained, and in the event that it is necessary to predict something rare (such as a rare disease), there are not going to be many example data. This generally causes the network to over-train with the more common classes, and this is something that Bayesian networks come to fix.\n",
        "In our case, we want to predict courses of the computer department of the PUC, a course that is mandatory for engineering is introduction to programming (IIC1103), a typical problem of a classic neural network for this case would always be to predict this course. The use of Bayesian networks will prevent this.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Bayesian neural networks\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bayesian part comes in two, each with an associated problem:\n",
        "1. Work with prior knowledge (* prior *), corresponding to different probability distributions on the weights of the network. The problem is, that in neural networks this knowledge has little to do with the structure itself. To solve this, we are going to work with * priors * that are not very informative for us, but which will also influence the network's decision making a lot. This is because it will no longer be \"yes\" or \"no\", but \"maybe\", and it will depend a lot on the current state of the network.\n",
        "2. To obtain correct predictions, the posterior one must be integrated. This is very demanding, or impossible in some cases. To solve this, we are going to work with samples on the network. As we are going to work with distributions on the parameters, after training we will have a network with the hyperparameters of each of the distributions, so we can take samples of networks, and thus decide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, the structure of the Bayesian network is defined in a very similar way to a multilayer perceptron, only now instead of fixed parameters, we are going to have probability distributions on the weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhenhua_Li12/publication/328757994/figure/fig1/AS:689808791830528@1541474640467/A-Bayesian-neural-network-with-one-hidden-layer.ppm)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Training\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several ways to train ranking models. The best known is backpropagation, which is based on taking gradients, and changing parameters in the direction of maximum growth. This method is not so good for Bayesian networks, since they take into account uncertainties, and backpropagation can go in that direction. We are going to focus on a method called * Bayes by Backprop *, created specifically to train networks of this type. It is based on that instead of training a single model, it trains an assembly of models, taking weights from a joint distribution. This method only doubles the number of parameters, but trains an infinite assembly of models using Monte Carlo methods (actually, of variational inference, since the methods already named are still very difficult in this context).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is impossible to calculate the integral of the parameters, so a variational inference method will be used to estimate the distribution, using ELBO as a loss function. In each iteration / epoch our program will take several samples of the parameters, and be guided by them.\n",
        "It should be noted that this is going to be done by the Pyro library, which we will talk about later.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Choice of priors\n",
        "\n",
        "Earlier we said that there is a problem in this part, although we have previous knowledge of the problem (that certain students should take as mesh), it is difficult to reflect this in the structure of a neural network. This is why we decided on normal distributions with initial parameters 0 and 1, for the mean and standard deviation respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Obtaining predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "To obtain model predictions, different samples of models will be generated. For each one of these models, they will be asked to which class the given input corresponds and if there is consensus on the class to which the input belongs, it will be decided by this. The Bayesian part comes when there is none consensus. Then, the network is going to be allowed to say \"I don't know\", which is a very valuable tool in our case. For example, when asked by a student who is not necessarily going to take a course of computing in the following semester, the network will not be forced to choose a class (course), but will say that it is not certain."

        "## Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to predict with Bayesian networks which courses students will be taking next semester, we had to carry out several steps, which are detailed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Investigating Bayesian Neural Networks\n",
        "Not much information is available on Bayesian methods, especially Bayesian neural networks. However, we found some python libraries that do this, such as Edward or Pyro, along with their respective tutorials. We decided to use Pyro, since it seemed easier to use, and was well documented.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Data processing\n",
        "Pyro is an implementation of Bayesian methods based on the Pytorch machine learning library, which is why we first had to bring the data we had to a training set, which would work with the aforementioned libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start by defining the structure of the network, a simple multilayer perceptron, with a hidden layer. For this, we decided to make an input array that contains all the information necessary to classify correctly, and an output array that contains the the courses that a certain input (student) will take.\n",
        "We obtained the data from the Computer Department, and consisted of an excel file with the following information in each row:\n",
        "\n",
        "- student id (anonymous)\n",
        "- Semester in which student is took the course\n",
        "- Career\n",
        "- Program which student is enrolled\n",
        "- Major and minor\n",
        "- Semester enrolled\n",
        "- Course\n",
        "- More information which is unnecesary\n",
        "\n",
        "We had to process all this information (detailed later) to obtain an input that can be entered into the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Classic Neural Network\n",
        "\n",
        "We decided to train a classic neural network, to compare results. It has the same structure as the Bayesian network, only with \"fixed\" parameters instead of distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Bayesian neural network\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the same network structure as in the previous part, we build and train the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Changes compared to the last version\n",
        "\n",
        "We decided to make several changes to the structures of our delivery 1 networks, with the main objective of making them better represent reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Network structure\n",
        "    - We tried different network structures, with more hidden layers, different activation functions.\n",
        "    - Network output: before, we had a log-softmax activation function, which was wrong, because is a function that expectes one class and only to be the correct one, and this is not the case.\n",
        "    - Since you can take more than one courses, we had to change the loss function for a more appropriate one. We chose `MultiLabelSoftMarginLoss`, which does exactly this.\n",
        "    - Now we have to choose if a student takes 0 or more courses, this is why we add confidence to the choice.\n",
        "2. Bayesian part\n",
        "    - Since the structure of the classical network is shared with the Bayesian one, for the Bayesian part of our project we made the same changes as in (1)\n",
        "    - Since the Bayesian network makes a decision with several samples of networks, we can calculate the variance in the output. By doing this, we can see if the result comes by chance or if the network really knows what it is saying."

Since we have no default values, a non-informative prior is established (a normal with zero mean and variance 1). Then, we use the pyro library to create a model that we adjust for our weights and compare the results of training the model with that of the actual data (to train). Furthermore, since we do not know the distribution of weights, variational bayes are used to approximate the distribution of weights to normal."

Although the results are not yet conclusive regarding the reliability of the recommender, they are heading towards what is a good vacancie recommender system, in which it conveniently estimates that each student will take and gives a degree of reliability to that choice. This recommender is expected to be upgradeable through the complexity of the network structure, allowing it to do not only a linear or quadratic analysis of the data (which is what usually happens with a layer), but also take advantage of convolutional capabilities and a deep learning for better analysis.\n",

Furthermore, choosing courses can be considered a difficult problem, from the point of view that a student can choose to postpone or take a courses for various reasons, in which two students who have taken the same courses can take different things next semester.\n",

In this way it is possible to classify better and for the rest not classified, analyze them in another way. Since the choice of branches is different for each student, a classifier that looks linearly or squarely at the data and sees direct correlations is not able to correctly classify the choice of students. Still, we can see that it is an effective method, that it is able to intuit the branches that a student is going to take and manages to make good predictions when he is confident in what he says.\n",
